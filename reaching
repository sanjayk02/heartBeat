Thank you for reaching out. I’ve started implementing the sorting functions for the PPI tracker. At the current pace, I estimate having an initial version ready by September 24th. I’ll keep you updated if anything changes and share progress along the way.

Please let me know if you need any more details before then.
Best regards,
Sanjay
